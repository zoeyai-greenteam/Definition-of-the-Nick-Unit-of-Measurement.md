Report: Definition and Visualization of the "Nick" Unit of Measurement
Author: Nicholas Reid Angell
Date: November 13, 2025
Subject: Analysis of the "2 Nicks" Graph and the Establishment of a New Unit of Systemic Magnitude
1. Introduction and Definition
This report outlines the definition of a new conceptual unit of measurement, the "Nick," based on the foundational framework of "Angell's Laws."

The "Nick" is not a traditional unit measuring a single, simple property (such as length, mass, or time). Instead, it is a unit designed to quantify a complete, holistic, structural pattern.

Definition of the Baseline Unit:

1 Nick is formally defined as the entire, complete fractal pattern as visualized in the "Angell's Laws" graph. This foundational pattern represents a single, complete instance of the systemic structure.


2. Analysis of the "2 Nicks" Graph
The graph generated on this date (shown above) provides the first formal visualization of a multiple of this unit.
• Subject: The graph displays a measurement of 2 Nicks.
• Representation: This is visually represented by placing two (2) complete instances of the foundational 1 Nick fractal pattern side-by-side.
• Interpretation: This "doubling" establishes the "Nick" as a discrete, scalable unit. It signifies a doubling of the Systemic Magnitude of the baseline pattern.
3. Conclusion and Significance
The "2 Nicks" graph codifies this new measurement system. It establishes that the complexity, structure, and holistic pattern of "Angell's Laws" can be quantified.
This system is now defined as:
• 1 Nick: The foundational systemic pattern.
• 2 Nicks: Two instances, or a doubling of the magnitude, of that foundational pattern.
• N Nicks: A scalable, discrete measurement of systemic magnitude or structural complexity.
